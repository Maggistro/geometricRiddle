polyeder representation:

NEXT:
- Get configuration spaces from object to objects ( basically collision ) 
-- test with multiple objects *
-- test with concave objects *
---- test getRims *
----- test getConvexPolygon *
------ sorting bug in getConvexPolygon -> returning mask leads to unsorted
        hulls *
----- test putting together of multiple convex subsets for getting 
        concave rims *
-- test with rotation
--- get rotations combinations ( works only till <5 objects )*
--- put spaces together ( each object adds 3 dimensions ) *
--- treat all objects equal, only diffrence should be the way the main object moves and the
    heuristik function
---- recalculate border if main object was rotated

TODO:
- find a way to calculate the main rim ( border ) of the full puzzle
-- recalculate the border after rotating an object



Ideas:

- split the configurationspace in tiles by expanding the vectors of
  the non-mainrim rims in the direction they are pointing ( excluding the
  connection vectors beetween the convex subsets ). Each tile can then be
  seen as a valid position in the search graph.
