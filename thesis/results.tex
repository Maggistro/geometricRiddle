\chapter{Results}
If we apply the finished Algorithm to various test data sets, we can get an impression of what the program is capable of.
\section{Small riddles}
Small riddles containing at most two objects beside the main object.
\section{Medium riddles}
Medium riddles containing at most 10 objects beside the main object. %really 10????
\section{Big riddles}
Big riddles with more than 10 objects beside the main object.
\section{Interpretation of testdata}
Compare the different timeframes to the amount of object, placement and, if solved, the way the algorithm took.
