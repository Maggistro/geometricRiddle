\section{Programming tools}
As the target of this thesis is a mere proof of concept, the programming language of choice is matlab \cite{tool:matlab}. This is a reasobable decision because in the matlab language a huge part of the needed functionality concerning simple mathematical functions is already implemented and easy to use. \\
Pros:
\begin{itemize}
\item easy to use mathematical function
\item fast and easy way to enter data
\item good and simple ways of debugging and locating errors 
\end{itemize}
Cons:
\begin{itemize}
\item slow computation speed
\item needs translation in other language ( e.g. c++ ) for further use
\end{itemize}
\\\\
As versioning tool git \cite{tool:git} is used together with www.github.com as an open source storage plattform for the resulting code.
