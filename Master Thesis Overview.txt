Introduction:
  - State problem in an abstract way
  - Define Problem more precise on a little usecase

Programming enviroment and tools.
  - Matlab
  - git
  
Programming Steps bottom-up

principle for solving problem
  - break down to multidimensional search
  - independence from raw object representation through interchangable functions
    (on the paper)

Object representation
  - point list
  - middle point
  
Used Algorithms
  - generation of Collisionbounds
  - linear programming for cell movement
  - ....
  
Configurationspaces
  - Define space
  - how to calculate it
  - what does it provide
  - problems and solutions ( with building total configuration space ( some calculations ))
  
Local Search
  - The function One Step
    - find next cell
    - find nearest border
    - put object in/infront of cell
    - recalculate configspace for other objects
  
  - Validation of next configuration
  - Problems and Solutions  
  
Results
  - discussion
  - applications

  - short overview of the whole topic
