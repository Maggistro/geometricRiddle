Introduction:
  - Elaborate use cases a bit more

Programming enviroment and tools.
  - get matlab bib entry
  
Basics
  - enter formula for angle beetween vectors
  - plots of A and B
  - enter formula for convex hull
  - think about linear programming explanation( usefull, if so another example )
  
  
  
  reprogram getConvexSubset with simple minX minY points ( why should that not work??)
  
Methods with function:
representation: Object1 = object.coeff = {[x0,x1,x2,below(-1)/above(1)],....}?
                          object.mid = [x,y,theta]
                          object.def = {[start, end],....}
  
.......................................................
Programming Steps bottom-up

principle for solving problem
  - break down to multidimensional search
  - independence from raw object representation through interchangable functions
    (on the paper)
    
Way one with points

Object representation
  - point list
  - middle point
  
Used Algorithms
  - generation of Collisionbounds
  - linear programming for cell movement
  - ....
  
Configurationspaces
  - Define space
  - how to calculate it
  - what does it provide
  - problems and solutions ( with building total configuration space ( some calculations ))
  
Local Search
  - The function One Step
    - find next cell
    - find nearest border
    - put object in/infront of cell
    - recalculate configspace for other objects
  
  - Validation of next configuration
  - Problems and Solutions  
  
Results
  - discussion
  - applications
  
Way two with functions ??

Summary
  - short overview of the whole topic
  - further uses and expansions
